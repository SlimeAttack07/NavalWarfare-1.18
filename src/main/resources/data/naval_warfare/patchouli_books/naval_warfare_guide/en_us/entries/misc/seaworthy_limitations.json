Because of this, removing/deregistering any ship with the $(l:naval_warfare:abilities/passive/seaworthy)Seaworthy/$ passive ability will cause the board to be reset to a new, empty board."

Note that you can still use the $(l:naval_warfare:misc/utility_tool)Utility Tool/$ to randomize all ship positions without causing a board reset. Using it to randomize only a ship with the Seaworthy passive will trigger the board reset if it fails to spawn on the first try."

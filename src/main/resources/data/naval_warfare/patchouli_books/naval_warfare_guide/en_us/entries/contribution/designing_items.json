If you're not (like me) but you built the ship as a structure, then I'll show you an easy way here that I've used for all ship items in the game."

(I'll be using paint.net for this example, just like I've used for the other ship textures).$(li)Change the canvas size so that the ship fits perfectly in it, to eliminate as much empty space as possible."

(So in this example, resizing 1240 to 64 would also automatically resize 670 to 35).$(li)Sharpen the image. (In paint.net you can use effects->photo->sharpen->amount = 20)"

As long as I can download the world the ship is in, I'll be able to make it for you."

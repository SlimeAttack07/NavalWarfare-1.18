# Naval Warfare V1.0.0 for Minecraft 1.18.1

## Description
This mod allows players to play the board game battleship with a twist. There are new ship shapes to confuse your opponents,
abilities to combo into devastating attacks and utilities to throw your opponents off guard. This mod takes heavy inspiration from a mobile app called SailCraft Battleships Online, which unfortunately  shut down on 28/08/2018 and is no longer available to play.

## Requirements
Although this mod can be played standalone, it is highly recommended that you also install the following two mods:
1. Jei: Allows you to view recipes. This mod has a lot of recipes that you'll need to know to make new ships, so this mod would be very useful.
2. Patchouli: Data API for guide books. This mod uses Patchouli to add a guide book that holds all of the documentation of this mod. Everything you need to know, from basic game requirements to ability and spell details is documented inside this guide book. Without Patchouli, the guide book will not show up.

## Notes
Naval Warfare is designed to be a multiplayer game. Although you can play against yourself if you want to, it'll be a lot more fun if you have friends to play with. This mod is fully survival friendly and you're allowed to include it in any modpack you want.
If you have any issues related to this mod, be sure to first check the 'Known Issues' page in the guide book / issues page on GitHub before posting a new issue.

If anything in the source code structure looks odd / different from convention, it is for a few reasons:
* This mod was originally made with MCP mappings for Minecraft 1.15. It was then updated to 1.16.4, and later on updated to 1.18.1. During these updates the conventions updated several times, causing misalignments between my naming styles and the naming conventions in the modding community. I'm not planning on changing those (they're just file/folder names after all)
* In the 1.18.1 update I switched to the official Mojang mappings, which is why some things don't allows allign (like constantly calling blockentities 'tileentity').
* Since I'm new to modding, several tutorials were followed in the creation of this mod. Some influences carried over here and there.

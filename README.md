# Naval Warfare V1.0.0 for Minecraft 1.18.1

## Description
This mod allows players to play the board game battleship with a twist. There are new ship shapes to confuse your opponents,
abilities to combo into devastating attacks and utilities to throw your opponents off guard. This mod takes heavy inspiration from a mobile app called SailCraft Battleships Online, which unfortunately  shut down on 28/08/2018 and is no longer available to play.

## Requirements
Although this mod can be played standalone, it is highly recommended that you also install the following two mods:
1. Jei: Allows you to view recipes. This mod has a lot of recipes that you'll need to know to make new ships, so this mod would be very useful.
2. Patchouli: Data API for guide books. This mod uses Patchouli to add a guide book that holds all of the documentation of this mod. Everything you need to know, from basic game requirements to ability and spell details is documented inside this guide book. Without Patchouli, the guide book will not show up.

## Notes
Naval Warfare is designed to be a multiplayer game. Although you can play against yourself if you want to, it'll be a lot more fun if you have friends to play with. This mod is fully survival friendly and you're allowed to include it in any modpack you want.
